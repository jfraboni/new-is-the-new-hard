new is the new hard
=============

Programming is really hard, it just seems so very hard, and every time I try to do it, I feel it's super hard!

Things that are hard seem to take a long time to do because they are so hard.

I wish things weren't so hard, if they weren't so hard, I would do them all day long!

Why are things so hard?
