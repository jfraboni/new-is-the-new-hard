New is the New Hard
=======================
A simple node script that replaces all occurrences of hard with new to illustrate that it's silly to think things are hard when in fact, they are simply new.

# Installation

### On runnable.com:
Create a new node app, and from the terminal, enter or cut and paste the following commands, then press enter or return:
    
    git clone https://github.com/jfraboni/new-is-the-new-hard.git && cd new-is-the-new-hard && ./setup.sh && cd - && source .bashrc
    
...some text will fly by as the repository is cloned locally and the project is setup.

Great, you're set to roll!
